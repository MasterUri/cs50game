The goal of the game is to sneak in to the bank, crack the safe in the far right office  and cneak out without being seen by the guards.
there are three guards that patrol the lobby. If they spot you - they will become alert, the doors to the bank will close and guards will chase you down and arrest you, which will result in a "You Loose!" screen appearing.

After the title screen, you start the game next to your van and have to make your way to the Bank entrance. 
In order to open the main door you have to play minigame to pick the lock. Press "Up Arrow" or "W" key to start the minigame.
To make it easier for players, a tooltip appears when you approach the door.
By using "Up/Down Arrow" or "W/S" keys you move the lockpick and by pressing "Right Arrow" or "D" keys you try to rotate the lock mechanism.
To make it easier for the player, there is a tooltip to the left of the lock in the minigame, that explains which keys to use in the minigame.
Lockpick has three positions (four if you count not inserted possintion) and the lock mechanism has three levels of rotation.
You will be able to rotate the lock to the next level only when the lockpick is in the rigth position (which is random every time you start the game). 
Each action has a distinctive sound to indicate it. After successfully rotating the mechanism three times you will hear an "unlock" sound and will be able to press "Right Arrow" or "D" keys to leave the minigame and open the door.

* The game in general is 2D and is made with .png sprites, but the minigames are 3D and were made with Blender. Implementing 3D elements into a 2D game came with some challenges that required calculating correct angles and implementing correct rotations of the moving parts and elements.

After unlocking the main door you can enter the lobby. But you have to be carefull not to bee seen by guards who are patroling the lobby by walking back and forth.
This level is straight forward and the only way to not be seen is to hide behind the bushes or in the doorways by pressing "Up Arrow" or "W" keys near the hiding spots. 
To exit the hiding spot press "Up Arrow" or "W" key one more time. To make it easier for players, a tooltip appears when you approach the hiding spot.
When you make it to the end of the lobby, you will be able to enter the office through the door by pressing "Up Arrow" or "W" keys.
To make it easier for players, a tooltip appears when you approach doors.

When you approach the safe, press "Up Arrow" or "W" key to start the minigame. To make it easier for players, a tooltip appears when you approach the safe.
This time you have to rotate the dial on the safe and get the correct combination to open the safe.
The combination is 3 numbers (1-7) (which is random every time you start the game). To rotate dial use "Left/Right Arrow" or "A/D" keys. To reset the minigame press "Up Arrow" or "W" keys.
You have to rotate the dial until you hear a distinctive "click" sound, which means you have found the correct dial position. First you have to rotate clockwise, then counter-clockwise and clockwise again for the third digit of the combination (just like in old spy movies).
If you rotate the dial full circle and don't hear the distinctive "click" sound - you have to reset the minigame because you have probably rotated too far and won't be able to recover.
After rotating the dial correctly three times you will hear an "unlock" sound and will be able to press "Right Arrow" or "D" keys to leave the minigame and open the safe door.

* The game in general is 2D and is made with .png sprites, but the minigames are 3D and were made with Blender. Implementing 3D elements into a 2D game came with some challenges that required calculating correct angles and implementing correct rotations of the moving parts and elements.

After unlocking the safe, player will receive a bag and will have to make his way back to the van without being spotted by the guards. When you make it to the van - the "You Win!" screan will appear and this will mean you have won the game. CONGRATULATIONS!


* All the sprites for this game were made from scratch using Asset Forge, Blender and Photoshop.
* There are two versions of player sprite: basic and with the bag.
* Doors have two sprites: opened and closed. To open the door you have to press "Up Arrow" or "W" keys. The door will close automatically when you step through it.
* Hiding spots have 3 sprites: empty, basic burglar hiding and burglar with a bag hiding.
* Minigames were made in blender and were thge most challenging to implement as they were 3D and required correct angle of rotation calculation.
